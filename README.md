# CS 350 Module Eight Journal

## Repository Overview

This repository contains artifacts from my CS 350 projects, showcasing my skills in emerging systems architectures and technologies. The projects demonstrate my ability to write interface software to control hardware components, analyze hardware architecture design, and justify technology decisions based on business requirements.

## Project Artifacts

- **SmartThermostat-Prototype**: A Raspberry Pi-based smart thermostat project that includes state machine functionality, sensor integration (AHT20), LED control, LCD display updates, and UART communication.
- **[Additional Artifact Name]**: [Short description of the second artifact you selected.]

## Reflection

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The smart thermostat project was designed to create a prototype for a connected thermostat. It addresses the need for a system that can monitor and control room temperature efficiently, send status updates to a server, and serve as a stepping stone for integrating with cloud-based services.

### What did you do particularly well?
I successfully implemented a state machine that seamlessly transitions between Off, Heat, and Cool modes. I also integrated multiple hardware components (sensors, LEDs, LCD, buttons, and UART) into one cohesive system. My code is modular, well-documented, and designed with maintainability in mind.

### Where could you improve?
While the system meets all the project requirements, I recognize that error handling and resource cleanup could be further enhanced, especially for production-level applications. Improving these aspects would ensure even more robust performance under varying conditions.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am expanding my support network with tools like GitHub for version control and project collaboration, as well as learning resources on Python programming for embedded systems. Additionally, online communities such as Stack Overflow and specialized forums for Raspberry Pi development are invaluable.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills in interfacing hardware with software, managing state machines, and working with real-time data (from sensors) are highly transferable. Moreover, my experience in writing clean, maintainable code and integrating multiple hardware components will be applicable to future embedded systems projects and IoT applications.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I followed best coding practices by writing modular functions, adding comprehensive comments, and organizing my code into logical sections. I used a state machine to separate concerns, ensuring each stateâ€™s behavior is encapsulated. This structure not only makes the project easier to understand and debug but also simplifies future enhancements and adaptations.

## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, reinforcing my ability to develop integrated hardware/software systems. I am confident that the skills and techniques demonstrated here will be applicable to a wide range of future projects in my computer science career.
