# CS 350 Module Eight Journal

## Repository Overview

This repository houses my portfolio artifacts from CS 350. These projects showcase my skills in emerging systems architectures and technologies through hands-on work with both hardware and software. In these projects, I designed and implemented interface software to control hardware components, conducted thorough debugging and testing, and documented my process extensively. My work demonstrates my ability to work with embedded systems, state machines, and integrated hardware-software solutions.

## Project Artifacts

- **SmartThermostat-Prototype**: A Raspberry Pi based smart thermostat featuring a state machine for off/heat/cool modes, AHT20 sensor integration, LED control, LCD display updates, and UART communication.
- **[Second Artifact Name]**: [A brief description of the second project artifact, highlighting its focus and your contributions.]

## Reflection

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The smart thermostat project was created to develop a prototype capable of monitoring and controlling room temperature. It addresses the need for an efficient and connected thermostat system, which can serve as the basis for a market-ready product with cloud connectivity. By integrating sensor data, LED indicators, and an LCD display, the project solves the problem of real-time temperature management and remote monitoring.

### What did you do particularly well?
I contributed significantly to all aspects of the project. I was deeply involved in coding the embedded software, composing the hardware configuration, and designing the system architecture. My efforts in debugging and testing ensured that the state machine and all peripheral integrations worked seamlessly. Additionally, I meticulously documented each stage of the project, making the design and code maintainable and easy to understand.

### Where could you improve?
While the project successfully meets its requirements, I see opportunities to improve by scaling the system further. I plan to work on developing a fully soldered, standalone embedded system version of the prototype, which would be more robust and better suited for real-world applications. This next step would involve deeper hardware integration and more advanced manufacturing techniques.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am leveraging GitHub for version control and collaboration, and I continuously engage with online communities such as Stack Overflow, Raspberry Pi forums, and embedded systems groups. Additionally, I am exploring new tools for hardware debugging and simulation, which will support my ongoing development work.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This project honed my skills in hardware-software integration, state machine design, and embedded system programmingâ€”all of which are highly transferable. The experience in interfacing with sensors, controlling LEDs, and managing real-time data feeds prepares me for future IoT projects and more complex system designs.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I emphasized modular design, clear code documentation, and a structured state machine approach to keep the project maintainable. By separating functionality into well-defined methods and classes, I ensured that the code remains readable and can be easily adapted for future enhancements. Additionally, thorough commenting and version control practices further contribute to the system's adaptability and long-term maintainability.

## Conclusion

This portfolio artifact represents my comprehensive involvement in designing, coding, testing, and documenting an integrated smart thermostat system. I am excited about the opportunity to further scale and refine this project into a fully standalone embedded solution in the future.
